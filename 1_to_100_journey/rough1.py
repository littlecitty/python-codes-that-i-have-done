Perfect 👍 I’ll go **slow and structured** so you can monitor everything clearly.
Let’s answer your questions step by step first, then I’ll write the **full code with `#` format** at the end.

---

## 1. 🔹 What is `mid + 1` and `mid - 1`?

* When we check the middle element (`mid`):

  * If the **target is greater** than `arr[mid]`, then we don’t need to check `mid` or anything **left of mid** (they’re smaller too).
    👉 So we search the **right half** by doing:
    `left = mid + 1`

  * If the **target is smaller** than `arr[mid]`, then we don’t need to check `mid` or anything **right of mid** (they’re bigger too).
    👉 So we search the **left half** by doing:
    `right = mid - 1`

> Yes, `mid` is an integer index, so `mid+1` and `mid-1` just mean “move the boundary” one step to exclude the already checked middle element.

---

## 2. 🔹 Difference between Iterative and Recursive Binary Search

* **Iterative version** → uses a `while` loop. We keep updating `left` and `right` until found.
* **Recursive version** → function calls itself again with new `left` and `right` values, narrowing the search range.

👉 Both do the same thing, but recursion uses **function calls instead of a loop**.

---

## 3. 🔹 Why does `mid + 1` mean "search right half"?

Because lists are **sorted**:

* Example: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`
  If `mid = 2` (value = `5`) and we want `7`, then all numbers **before and at index 2** are ≤ 5, so useless.
  So we start searching from `mid + 1` (index 3).
* Similarly, if we want `3`, we search **only before mid** → `mid - 1`.

---

## 4. 🔹 What is `O(log n)` vs `O(n)`?

* **Linear Search (O(n))**: checks each element one by one. Worst case = look at all `n` elements.
  Example: searching in `[1, 2, 3, ..., 1000000]` → might need **1,000,000 checks**.

* **Binary Search (O(log n))**: cuts the search space in half each time.
  Example: in the same list of **1,000,000 elements**, binary search needs only about **20 checks** (because log₂(1,000,000) ≈ 20).

👉 That’s why binary search is way faster, but **requires the list to be sorted**.

---

## 5. 🔹 Easier Full Code in `#` Format

Here’s the **binary search (recursive)** version with comments in your preferred style:

```python
#Focus: recursion, decorators, algorithms, regular expressions, multithreading
# 71. Implement binary search.

def binary_search(arr, left, right, target):
    # Base case: if range is invalid → target not found
    if left > right:
        return -1
    
    # Find the middle index
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    
    # Case 1: Target is exactly at mid
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    
    # Case 2: Target is smaller → search in LEFT half
    elif arr[mid] > target:
        return binary_search(arr, left, mid - 1, target)
    
    # Case 3: Target is larger → search in RIGHT half
    else:
        return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, right, target)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
    target = 7
    result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target)
    
    if result != -1:
        print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}")
    else:
        print(f"Element {target} not found in the list")
```

✅ This is the **recursive version** in easy format.
👉 Do you also want me to write the **iterative version in the same `#` format**, so you can compare both directly?
